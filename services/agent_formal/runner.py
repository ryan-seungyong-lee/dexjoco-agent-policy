"""One live agent per held-out formal episode, behind the supervisor's normal episode.

Supervisor._run_episode reserves the layout, starts the native episode, enforces the
wall limit and evaluates natively; this runner replaces the frozen controller with a
copy of the exploring agent (Codex or Claude Code), run natively in its CLI's sandbox.
The copy starts in a fresh workspace holding only the transfer package and, unless the
context is 'clear', the conversation. It sees its own episode's frames, never the
exploration frame history. Robot tools and development Python reach the gateway through
the copy's own socket; lifecycle tools do not exist here.
